            <h1>Project 3 - Face Morphing</h1>

            <h2>Part 1: Defining Correspondences</h2>

            <p>I used the provided tool and created a set of correspondences
            between my own image and Steven Spielberg (after resizing and
            cropping):</p>

            <article class="grid" class="jpg-section">
                <div class="jpg-images">
                    <img src="images/source_img.jpg" width="300em">
                    <p class="jpg-title">My Picture</p>
                </div>
                <div class="jpg-images">
                    <img src="images/target_img.jpg" width="300em">
                    <p class="jpg-title">Steven Spielberg</p>
                </div>
            </article>

            <p>After this, I used the <code>Delaunay</code> function from <code>scipy</code>
            to generate the triangulation. Here are the three triangulations
            (my picture, average, and steven Spielberg):</p>

            <article class="grid" class="jpg-section">
                <div class="jpg-images">
                    <img src="images/keypoints_mesh.png" width="900em">
                    <p class="jpg-title">Triangulations (Mine, Average, Steven)</p>
                </div>
            </article>

            <h2>Part 2: Computing the Midway Face</h2>

            <p>After this, I implemented the affine warp function to create
            a midway face. To do this, I use the least squares method to solve
            for the affine transformation, which gives us <code>a, b, c, d, e, f, g</code>
            These then are used to create the <code>A</code> matrix, which
            can be then used on arbitrary triangles in the future. Finally,
            the last step for triangle warp is to use the linear interpolator
            to also warp the pixels within the triangles. Looping over the triangles,
            we can now warp every triangle to some triangulation. Here is the midway face:</p>

            <article class="grid" class="jpg-section">
                <div class="jpg-images">
                    <img src="images/midway_face.jpg" width="500em">
                    <p class="jpg-title">Midway Face</p>
                </div>
            </article>

            <h2>Part 3: The Morph Sequence</h2>

            <p>
                After this, the natural next step is to create a morphing
                transition sequence between my original image and Steven
                Spielberg. To do this, we simply choose some
                <code>alpha</code> values and make weighted sums of both
                the shape (triangulation) and color (pixels) of the two images.
                Here are the results:
            </p>

            <article class="grid" class="jpg-section">
                <div class="jpg-images">
                    <img src="images/tejas_to_steven.gif" width="500em">
                    <p class="jpg-title">Morph Sequence (Tejas to Steven)</p>
                </div>
            </article>

            <h2>Part 4: Mean Face of Population</h2>

            <p>Once we have this, we can do some more statistical analysis using
            a full population's facial images. We choose the FEI Face dataset
            and take 400 images with 46 keypoints each (we also add corner keypoints).
            Then, we use the <code>Delaunay</code> function to generate the
            triangulation. We use the <code>mean</code> function to compute the
            mean of the triangulation. The mean is then used to warp the
            keypoints of the triangulation to the mean of the population
            images. Finally, we can use the <code>interpolate</code> function
            to warp the pixels within the triangles to the mean of the population.
            Here are the results:</p>
            
            <article class="grid" class="jpg-section">
                <div class="jpg-images">
                    <img src="images/mean.jpg" width="300em">
                    <p class="jpg-title">Mean of Population</p>
                </div>
                <div class="jpg-images">
                    <img src="images/pop1.jpg" width="100em">
                    <img src="images/pop2.jpg" width="100em">
                    <img src="images/pop3.jpg" width="100em">
                    <img src="images/pop4.jpg" width="100em">
                    <p class="jpg-title">Examples of Population Images Warped to Mean</p>
                </div>
            </article>

            <p>Next, we warp my own face to the population mean geometry
                and warp the population mean to my own geometry. This was done
                by creating keypoints matching the dataset's for my own
                picture and then using the <code>warp_triangles</code> function from before.
                These results
                look a little wonky just because it was hard to scale them
                so they look similar.
                Here are the results:
            </p>

                    <p class="jpg-title">My Picture Warped to Mean</p>

                </div>
            </article>

            <h2>Part 5: Caricatures</h2>

            <p>Finally, we can extrapolate my face from the population
                mean by choosing <code>alpha</code> values greater than 1
                or less than 0. This creates an interesting caricature effect
                (some median filter is used to remove artifacts):
            </p>

            <article class="grid" class="jpg-section">
                <div class="jpg-images">
                    <img src="images/caricature_0.5.jpg" width="300em">
                    <p class="jpg-title">Alpha: -0.5</p>
                </div>
                <div class="jpg-images">
                    <img src="images/caricature_2.0.jpg" width="300em">
                    <p class="jpg-title">Alpha: 2.0</p>
                </div>
            </article>


            <h2>Bells and Whistles: Morphing Gender</h2>

            <p>I chose to do the first bell/whistle, which was trying to convert
            my face's gender into another gender using a specific population mean.
            For this, I used <a href="https://sciencephotogallery.com/featured/average-beauty-composite-face-of-60-women-d-perrett-k-may--s-yoshikawa-university-of-st-andrewsscience-photo-library.html">this</a>
            image (displayed below). Then, I used the earlier techniques to 
            first blend the shapes, then the colors, then both at once.
            Here is the result:</p>

            <article class="grid" class="jpg-section">
                <div class="jpg-images">
                    <img src="images/shape_only.gif" width="300em">
                    <p class="jpg-title">Shape Only</p>
                </div>
                <div class="jpg-images">
                    <img src="images/appearance_only.gif" width="300em">
                    <p class="jpg-title">Appearance Only</p>
                </div>
                <div class="jpg-images">
                    <img src="images/both.gif" width="300em">
                    <p class="jpg-title">Both</p>
                </div>
            </article>

            <p>And so I conclude this project!</p>
